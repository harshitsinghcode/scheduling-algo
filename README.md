# Priority-Based I/O Device Scheduling - DA III [OS] 🕐

A game theory-based approach to I/O resource allocation that outperforms traditional scheduling algorithms :>

## Quick Start 🔍

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/harshitsinghcode/scheduling-algo.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd scheduling-algo

# Run the application (open in your browser)
open index.html
```

## Usage 🔨

1. Select simulation parameters:
   - Number of Processes (5-20)
   - Number of I/O Devices (3-7)
   - Scheduling Algorithm (FCFS, RR, PBS_PRO, Nash-Priority)
   - Auction Mechanism (First-price, Second-price, Dynamic)

2. Click "Run Simulation" to see performance metrics and comparisons
